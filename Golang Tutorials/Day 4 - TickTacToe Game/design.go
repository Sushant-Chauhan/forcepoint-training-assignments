/*
Design :
Game interface -  facade design pattern
TicTacToe struct  - implements the Game interface (board and players)
NewGame method   - sets up the game, players, and the board.
play method - updates the board and checks for a winner.
TPlayer, Board, and Cell structs - for tictactoe game
